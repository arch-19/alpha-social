# alpha-social
Design fiction project for the class Intro to Ubiquitous Computing

## Project Summary
α-Social is a design fiction depicting a future where augmented reality (AR) technology has become ubiquitous and all-encompassing in scope. We explore the sociotechnical implications of the adoption of such a technology by transcribing modern trends and implications to this designed future. The effects of social media filter bubbles, gossiping technology, alpha convenience, and personalization in this AR future are examined.

## Design Process



Preliminary Sketches

The design process of creating α-Social started out by initially listing down all the social media paradigms that are existing in the world today. We imagined a world  in which everyday objects are seamlessly integrated with the Internet. Given the rapid development of IoT, this vision seems quite conceivable. We examined the impacts of these pervasive ubiquitous technologies on the people who have access to such technology and those who do not. We discussed the physical, social, personal and economic consequences of such technology. 

Technologies and Functions

Glasses are the epicenter of personalized computing in this distant future. They are the lens through which all meaning and context are absorbed by the inhabitants of the world. The glasses are also capable of sensing hand movements to interact with the various UI dispersed in the environment. Accompanying these glasses are comforatble bodysuits that allow the digital overlay of personalized clothing. This bodysuit allows clothing and other physical characteristics to be manipulated and interchangeable within augmented reality depending on the whims of the wearer and the social context.

World Building
World building exercise is the most crucial and time consuming in Design Fiction. We spent hours debating the rules and the functioning of our imagined near future world. We brainstormed rigorously on the types of technologies, their impact on societies, culture and individuals.
Economy: Through alpha social we looked into the aspects of economy. We brought out the impacts of the ever widening gap between different countries, the technological imbalance and the problems arising today which could amplify in the near future.
Bureaucracy and Governance: Paul Dourish & Genevieve Bell in their work contend that “Alongside any technology, it is userful to imagine the kinds of administrative and bureaucratic structures that must be introduced alongside those technologies as a means to regulate and manage their use and structure the lives of those making such use.” We laid down these foundations while world building and closely built our narrative around those rules of governance.

The Future Map
“a Design Fiction is the map of our fictional world that can be explored in a variety of ways and a narrative, if used, would be a distinct path through this fictional world. In this way a variety of prototypes, situations, and – somewhat ironically – ‘stories’, can be nurtured on the substrate of the artificially constructed world”
Privacy Concerns: Through the narrative we highlighted the privacy and security issues ubiquitous technology encompasses. IoT is connecting countless devices through Internet. More and more information is being captured sometimes without the knowledge of the user.

Relationships and Networks: The design fiction captures the nuances of human relationships and how personal lives are affected by utmost interference of technology. The differences in world with and without glasses show the emotional, psychological impact technology can cause when it is integrated so intrinsically in everyone’s lives. Through the story plots we aimed to showcase the different networks such as family, friends, professional circles and how social media adapts according to the circle.  

We examined the effects of remote collaboration and virtual connections. The paradox we portrayed is similar to the phone. While we see the phone as “connecting” people, it is the same phone that gives you the liberty to be away from your loved ones for long periods of time. Thus, it is an unbalanced question in itself whether all the technology we’re creating is beneficial in real sense.

The Narrative
Through the story-line we captured the essence of how people would communicate, interact and consume information. We touched upon several topics taught under the course ubiquitous computing and wove out a creative piece brimming with elements of impact, emotions and technical subtleties.
